<div class="custom-container tip">
  <p class="custom-container-title">EDM BEST PRACTICES</p>
  <p>When mastering electronic dance music, implement a "bass trinity" approach: high-pass below the usable range (typically 25-30Hz), use multiband dynamics to create consistent low-end energy, and employ mid/side techniques to centralize bass content below 150Hz. This creates the powerful, controlled low end essential for club systems while maintaining clarity across the mix.</p>
