Check files in at least three different applications, including one from the intended distribution ecosystem, to ensure metadata is properly implemented and visible where it matters.</p>
</div>

## The Importance of ISRC Codes

ISRC codes provide unique identification essential for tracking and monetization in the digital ecosystem.

## Understanding ISRC

International Standard Recording Codes serve as the digital fingerprint for recordings:

**ISRC Fundamentals**:
- Globally unique identifiers for sound recordings and music videos
- 12-character alphanumeric codes following a specific format
- Format: Country Code (2) + Registrant Code (3) + Year (2) + Designation (5)
- Example: US-ABC-19-00001
- Identifies the specific recording, not the composition itself
- Remains with the recording regardless of ownership changes
- Different from UPC/EAN codes which identify the overall release
- Administered by IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry)

**Purpose and Function**:
- Enables accurate tracking of usage and plays across platforms
- Ensures proper attribution of royalties and payments
- Facilitates rights management across international boundaries
- Simplifies licensing and legal compliance
- Reduces confusion between different versions or recordings
- Provides persistent identification throughout the digital ecosystem
- Essential for automated royalty systems
- Creates clear differentiation between different masters of the same composition

**Lifespan and Persistence**:
- ISRC codes remain with a specific recording permanently
- New versions, remixes, or remasters receive new codes
- Different length edits typically receive unique codes
- Live recordings receive separate codes from studio versions
- The code identifies the specific master, not just the song
- Reprocessed or altered masters may require new codes depending on extent of changes
- Once assigned, ISRC codes should never change for that specific recording

Understanding these ISRC fundamentals helps mastering engineers properly implement this critical identification system.

## Obtaining and Implementing ISRC Codes

Proper ISRC implementation requires understanding both acquisition and technical application:

**Obtaining ISRC Codes**:
- Record labels typically have their own registrant code and issue ISRCs
- Independent artists can obtain codes through various channels:
  - National ISRC agencies in their country
  - Distributors who provide ISRC assignment services
  - Specialized ISRC managers and services
  - Some performing rights organizations
- Annual fees may apply for maintaining a registrant code
- Some distribution platforms offer ISRC assignment
- Many digital aggregators include ISRC generation in their services
- The registrant is responsible for maintaining records of assigned codes

**Technical Implementation**:
- Embedding in WAV/AIFF metadata (BWF chunk or INFO fields)
- Including in CD masters as PQ subcodes
- Adding to digital delivery packages for streaming platforms
- Incorporating in encoding software when creating compressed formats
- Including in DDP images for physical production
- Documenting in accompanying spreadsheets and metadata files
- Registering with relevant performance rights organizations
- Reporting to distribution and streaming services

**Implementation Timing**:
- ISRCs should be assigned before mastering completion if possible
- Typically implemented during the final mastering stage
- Must be in place before distribution begins
- Should be embedded directly in master files
- Required for proper CD production
- Essential before sending to digital aggregators
- Ideally documented in session files and delivery notes

Proper ISRC implementation ensures recordings can be correctly identified, tracked, and monetized throughout their commercial lifespan.

## ISRC Best Practices

Following industry standards for ISRC implementation helps avoid common problems:

**Version Management**:
- Assign unique ISRCs to each distinct version or edit
- Radio edits, extended versions, and remixes need separate codes
- Remastered versions usually receive new codes if significantly different
- Instrumental versions require unique ISRCs
- Live recordings always need distinct codes from studio versions
- Different language versions should have unique identifiers
- Maintain clear documentation of all related versions

**Implementation Verification**:
- Verify ISRC embedding in final masters before distribution
- Check CD subcode information in DDP images
- Confirm code format validity and structural correctness
- Ensure consistency across different format deliverables
- Document ISRCs in multiple locations for redundancy
- Maintain master spreadsheets of assigned codes
- Include ISRCs in file naming when appropriate

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Reusing codes across different versions or recordings
- Assigning new codes to unchanged recordings
- Formatting errors in code structure
- Inconsistent implementation across different formats
- Missing documentation of assigned codes
- Failure to register codes with performance rights organizations
- Inconsistency between embedded codes and reported metadata

These best practices help ensure ISRC implementation serves its purpose of providing reliable, persistent identification throughout the recording's commercial life.

<div class="custom-container warning">
  <p class="custom-container-title">ISRC DUPLICATION DANGERS</p>
  <p>Never reuse ISRC codes across different recordings or significant alternate versions. Doing so can lead to misattributed plays, royalty payment errors, and metadata confusion across platforms. Once an ISRC is assigned to a specific recording, any substantially different version must receive a new code. When in doubt, assign a new ISRC rather than reusing an existing one.</p>
